# Scientific-paper-scraping
Capture the content of all articles published by a journal within a certain period of time.


# 1. Initial URLs
When starting, you need to provide one or more initial URLs as the starting point for the crawler.

# 2. Send a request
The crawler selects a URL from the URL queue to be crawled and sends an HTTP request to the server corresponding to the URL.

# 3. Receive response
The server responds to this request and returns relevant web page content, usually in HTML, XML or JSON format.

# 4. Content analysis
The crawler parses the received web page content. Extract the required data, or find other links in the web page and add them to the queue of URLs to be crawled.

# 5. Data storage
The crawler saves the extracted data in a predetermined location, which can be a database, file system, or any other storage mechanism.

# 6. Loop
The crawler returns to step 2, selects the next URL to crawl, and repeats the above process.

# 7. Exit conditions
In order to prevent the crawler from running indefinitely, some exit conditions are usually set, such as:

The number of pages crawled reached the predetermined limit.

All required data has been captured.

All links have been visited.
